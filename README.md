Alternative (more granular) approach to a DNS library.

Completely usable as a DNS client library. Most widely used Resource
Records are supported. DNSSEC types are too (except NSEC/NSEC3, for now). EDNS0
is (see edns.go), UDP/TCP queries, AXFR (and IXFR probably too) supported.

Installation is done by running: ./install

Sample programs can be found in the _examples directory. They can 
be build with: make examples

Have fun!

Implemented RFCS:

* RFC 2671, EDNS
* RRC 3225, DO bit
* RFC 3110, RSA in DNS  
* RFC 1034/1035
* RFC 4033/4034/4035 
* RFC 5155 (NSEC3)
* And all that I forgot

Loosely based upon:
* ldns
* NSD
* Net::DNS
